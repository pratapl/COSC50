    I've implemented most of the functions as suggested in the assignment/lab. 
    Amongst them are list.c and hashtable.c. I have implemented methods like 
    hashTableLookup, AddToHashTable, AppendToList, etc as suggested in these files. 

    I have also deviated slightly from the suggested implementation method for the project.
    I have not passed the address to initializeList (&URLList) as suggested - primarily because
    I had already implemented the function prior to the suggestion being made by the professor. 

    I have assumed that the only acceptable input url is the default url suggested,
    http://old-www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/tse.Depth can be in the range [0-4].All the
    corresponding html files will be saved in incremental numbers starting at 1. 

    The data folder in src is to store the data files after retrieving the html pages.
