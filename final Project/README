Description: README file for the project. 


Compliation:
    Makefile should be used to build and run the client startup script, AMStartup.  
    Use the following commands, 

    make clean
    make

Running:
    usage: ./AMStartup -n nAvatar -d difficulty -h serverLocatoin
    
    valid ranges:
    nAvatar: 2 - 10
    difficulty: 0 - 9
    serverLocation: stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu, or , tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu
    
Testing:
    MazeBATS.sh covers the following cases. 
        
        ***Build***
        Clean 
        Compile 
      
        ***Invalid Argument Testing***
        Less argument ( argc = 3 )
        More argument ( argc = 5 )
        Invalid nAvatar ( nAvatar = -20 )
        Invalid nAvatar ( nAvatar = 20)
        Invalid nAvatar ( nAvatar = abc)
        Invalid difficulty ( difficulty = -50 )
        Invalid difficulty ( difficulty = 50 )
        Invalid difficulty ( difficulty = abc

        ***Valid Argument Testing***
        nAvatar = 2, difficulty = 0, server = stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu (minimum values)
        nAvatar = 3, difficulty = 3, server = stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu   
        nAvatar = 6, difficulty = 6, server = stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu 
        nAvatar = 10, difficulty = 9, server = stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu (maximum values)
        
    The results are saved in a log file named Testlog.timeStamp, where timeStamp is the
    timestamp of executing the MazeBATS.sh

Design:
    Design details can be found in Design_Documentation_Cabernet.pdf

Assumptions:

    1) It is assumed that the maze generated by the server is a perfect maze. 
       This implies that there is only one path from a point to another in the maze. 
       It also means that there are no circular loops or open paths. 
    2) Argument checking for server location is not performed because it is assumed 
       that the input for -h is either stowe.cs.dartmouth.edu or tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu
