Test.txt 
This file explains approaches I took for testing. 
************************************************

First of all, I tried different combination of switches. 
./dog
./dog -
./dog -n
./dog -n -m encryptFile.txt
./dog -n -M decryptFile.txt
./dog -n -m encryptFile.txt -M decryptFile.txt
./dog -n -m encryptFile.txt > someFile.txt

Such combinations stated above all worked fine with 
encryptFile.txt which abides by the needed conditions for encryption. 

When tried with a invalid encryption file encryptSame.txt (violates one-to-one
mapping) error is thrown back at the user. Similarly, when encrypted with
encryptMoreLines.txt which contains more than 26 lines, error message is displayed.
