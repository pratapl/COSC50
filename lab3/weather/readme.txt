Compiling instruction:
mygcc -o filename weather.c mycurl.c -lcurl
 
Assumptions:

I have not been able to implement the following things:
Location Code is not checked
Required properites like credit, temperature, etc are not displayed. 
Rather, the whole page is displayed, linewise. 

What I have implemented:
Reading the page using the curl library
Checking if the return is valid(i.e the first 5 chars are <?xml
