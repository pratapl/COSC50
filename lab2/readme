I have to apologize because I did not allocate my time properly
to write the README and TESTING files. I have tried my best to 
write clean, readable documented code however. 

For spy.sh, I could not actually spy people on the server. The log report 
is basically of myself spying me. 

I will try to include such files from the next assignment. 
Thank you
